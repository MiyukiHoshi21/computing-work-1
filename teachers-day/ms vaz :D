For Ms Vaz 

/a poem


Dear Ms Vaz

When you first stepped into our class
we were greeted with a laugh
At first we were a little tense
but you made everything make sense
Sometimes you're harsh on us

I love your poem! I think you can add another stanza because this sounds pretty incomplete on its own. Like you can add how she makes lessons fun and tries to engage the whole class or you can elaborate a bit more on the first stanza.
